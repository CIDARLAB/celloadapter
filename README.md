# Cello Adapter

Cello Adapter is a Java based client for working with data on Cello. Currently Cello Adapter only supports the extraction of Netlists and 
Transfer Functions (.gp files) as a part of the results used by Fluigi. 

The goal of this project is to provide an archetype for building API adapters that can retrieve and use data from Cello.
